# Introduction
Cataracts are a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to build a model that can classify eye images as either having cataracts or not.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle. You can download the dataset from the following link:

Kaggle Cataract Eye Dataset - [Kaggle Cataract Eye Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nandanp6/cataract-image-dataset)

# Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

# Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Rakshithg6/Cataract_Eye_Detection.git
cd Cataract_Eye_Detection

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Ensure you have downloaded the dataset from Kaggle and placed it in the appropriate directory.

Preprocess the data:

python preprocess_data.py

Train the model:

python train.py

Evaluate the model:

python evaluate.py
Model


The model architecture is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It includes several layers of convolutions, pooling, and dense layers to extract features and perform classification. The detailed architecture can be found in the model.py file.

# Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of X% on the validation set. Detailed performance metrics and visualizations are provided in the results directory.
